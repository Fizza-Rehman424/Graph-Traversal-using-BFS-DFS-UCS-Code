# Country Map Pathfinding Website

This website allows users to find a path between two cities using three algorithms: BFS, DFS, and UCS. The website displays the path, total cost (for UCS), for each algorithm. 
# Country Map Pathfinding with Route Addition

This website allows users to:
- Find paths between cities using BFS, DFS, and UCS algorithms.
- Add new routes between cities with costs only for UCS.

## Features:
- Add routes between cities dynamically.
- View the found path, total cost (if applicable), and time complexity.
- Compare the performance of BFS, DFS, and UCS algorithms.

## Example Usage:
- Input a start city and end city.
- Select an algorithm (BFS, DFS, UCS).
- View the result.
- Add new routes dynamically to the map and re-run the algorithms.

## Algorithms:
- **BFS**: Breadth-First Search
- **DFS**: Depth-First Search
- **UCS**: Uniform Cost Search
