This website allows users to find a path between two cities using three algorithms: BFS, DFS, and UCS. The website displays the path, total cost (for UCS), for each algorithm. 
# Country Map Pathfinding with Route Addition

This website allows users to:
- Find paths between cities using BFS, DFS, and UCS algorithms.
- Add new routes between cities with costs only for UCS.

## Features:
- Add routes between cities dynamically.
- View the found path, total cost (if applicable), and time complexity.
- Compare the performance of BFS, DFS, and UCS algorithms.
